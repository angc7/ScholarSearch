# ScholarSearch
ScholarSearch is a web based organizational platform and educational resource where students can search, sort, manage, and filter through a database of scholarships offered by Ontario Universities, all in one place. By creating a profile, users can save scholarships and manage their bookmarks, and have their own customized feed display potential relevant scholarships based on their information and bookmarks (ex. same discipline and location). The individual scholarship cards themselves will contain all relevant information, as well as related links in order to connect the user directly to the respective university's page to apply.
